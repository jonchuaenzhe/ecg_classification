# ECG Classification CNN Model

This project uses a CNN to predict whether an ECG signal is normal or abnormal from a 2D plot of the ECG. The dataset was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/shayanfazeli/heartbeat

As it was done on google colab, I mounted my drive onto the notebook. To run this project locally, simply change the root path and save the data files accordingly

In depth project descriptions are in the notebooks

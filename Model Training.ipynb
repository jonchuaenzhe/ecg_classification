With some portable ECG devices already in the market, an automatic ECG interpretation will allow users to know if they should seek further medical advice. This ECG dataset comprises of over 4000 normal ECGs and 10,000 ECGs, with each data entry representing one heart beat and stored in a normalized array of 187 values. While it is possible to use a RNN to analyze it (and it may well be the best and most efficient method), humans generally analyze ECGs as a 2D graph. Thus, I aim to build a CNN that will mimick a human doctor to interpret the ECG and determine if it is abnormal."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7gm-sa6vE8oF","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Building the Model\n","After processing the data and saving them as png images in google drive, this notebook will load the data and train a CNN model to classify the 2 categories of ECGs (normal and abnormal)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Bijcw1vHr1Gk","colab_type":"code","outputId":"1d96ae62-a7bf-4afb-9139-272344b22b2a","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1591709988481,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":1159,"user":{"displayName":"Jonathan Chua","photoUrl":"","userId":"08819300102591942470"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34}},"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/gdrive')\n","\n","root_path = 'gdrive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/JumpStart Intro to Deep Learning'"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/gdrive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/gdrive\", force_remount=True).\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"RcdwPCdCWKUM","colab_type":"code","outputId":"e84d305a-8a68-403b-c2b2-fcbae0494bb1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1591709995975,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":8443,"user":{"displayName":"Jonathan Chua","photoUrl":"","userId":"08819300102591942470"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":52}},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import numpy as np\n","from PIL import Image\n","\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","import tensorflow.keras\n","\n","from tensorflow.keras.models import Model\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Flatten,Input\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D\n","from tensorflow.keras.regularizers import l2"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/statsmodels/tools/_testing.py:19: FutureWarning: pandas.util.testing is deprecated.
